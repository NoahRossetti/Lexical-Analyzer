0. text sorter (overall main function)
- detects and ignores whitespace
- detects and ignores comments
- detects symbols
- detects when something might be a keyword or variable and calls for a dictionary check
- detects when input too large
- produces error messages

1. source file
- seems easy enough, we just print out the input we used right?

2. lexeme list
- lexeme list implemented using dynamically allocated 2d array (or maybe just a wasteful massive preset array based on max size idk if he cares)
- use text sorter to send symbols and their token directly to the lexeme list
- use trie dictionary to look for keywords
- if buffer string not found in dicitonary, store in lexeme list and categorize it as identsym (2). (maybe ill add vars to the tree idk)

3. token list
- doesnt seem bad either just gotta build it from the lexeme list
