# Homework 2: Lexical Analyzer

## Description
This c program is designed to intake a file containing a program in the programming language PL0/ and identify the symbols, reserved words, variable names, and values contained within.
These data are considered valid "lexemes".
All whitespace is ignored in this program, as is syntax.
After identifying all the lexemes in the file, the program outputs a file containing the raw input it analyzed, the lexeme table (containing the lexeme list and the token values), and the token list.



## Compilation Instructions
To compile and run this program, first open a bash terminal and navigate to the directory containing lex.c and the input file.
To compile, "gcc lex.c"
To run program, "./a.out input.txt" (input.txt is a placeholder name it can be any file name)

## Usage
[How to run the program, including any required arguments]
Immediately after compiling, use "./a.out" to run the program.
